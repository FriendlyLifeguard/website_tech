We will be looking at how variables are declared and referenced/dereferenced in rust.

<br></br>

This variable is immutable and referenced variable cannot change the value of _y_

```
let x: u64 = 10
```

This variable is mutable and referenced variable can change the value of _y_

```
let mut y: u64 = 10
```

This variable has an immutable reference to _x_ therefore, it cannot be dereferenced to change its value

```
let z: &u64 = &x
```

This variable has a mutable reference to y and can change the value of _y_

```
let b: &u64 = &mut y
```

**You can also make immutable references to mutable variables**

```
let n: &u64 = &y
```

The following variable makes immutable references to _y_ therefore, intentionally declaring an immutable variable that references a mutable variable, _y_.
