After Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022, a lot of things have changed on the consensus layer. 

This article will highlight some of the key changes in Ethereum 2.0 or as it is called now, the Beacon Chain.

Let dive in! 

## New Roles

Under PoW consensus, network participants were known as **miners** that raced to generate a unique hash with a fixed length of leading zeros to be able to add a new block to the blockchain. This required active usage of ASICs or GPUs which lead to high energy consumption.

However, under PoS consensus, network participants have transitioned from actively generating millions of hashes to voting and proposing a new block all under algorithmic control. These participants are called **validators**. This transition lead to reduction in energy consumption by 99.9% which helped in diminishing the negative sentiment of blockchain technology.

## Introduction to Validators

Validator is a new role that didn't exist previously in PoW consensus. To be able to become a validator, you need to deposit/stake 32 ETH into a Beacon Chain client. *([Guide](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) to get started on becoming a validator.)*

In Beacon Chain, blocks can be organized into slots and epochs. A slot appears every 12 seconds and an epoch contains 32 slots (appears every 6.4 minutes) and it is used to create checkpoints to reach block/transaction finality which will get into it in later sections.

From the active pool of validators, a subset of validators can become either part of a committee or a block proposer. Both selection processes are pseudorandom and determined by RANDAO. 

1. If a validator becomes a block proposer, the validator can propose a new block on the designated slot however, an empty slot can exist in case the block proposer is inactive and the validator is not penalized for not proposing a block.

2. If a validator becomes part of a committee, each committee is delegated to each slot within an epoch to attest on the proposed block. More than one committee can exist in each slot.

The assignments of committees and block proposer selection happens before an epoch starts. Specifically, they are determined at the end of previous epoch. 


## Attesting and Reaching Finality 

Validators vote or attest to a proposed block but they also attest on a given checkpoint. This is to ensure that past proposed blocks can reach finality which means that the blocks and its contained transactions are irreversible.

Two types of attestations: 

1. Attesting on individual block within a slot (LMD Ghost Vote)
2. Attesting on a checkpoint (FFG Vote)
