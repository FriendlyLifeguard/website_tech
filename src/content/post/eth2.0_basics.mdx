After Ethereum transitioned from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) in September 2022, a lot of things have changed on the consensus layer.

This article will highlight some of the key changes in Ethereum 2.0 or as it is called now, the Beacon Chain.

Let dive in!

## New Roles

Under PoW consensus, network participants were known as **miners** that raced to generate a unique hash with a fixed length of leading zeros to be able to add a new block to the blockchain. This required active usage of ASICs or GPUs which lead to high energy consumption.

However, under PoS consensus, network participants have transitioned from actively generating millions of hashes to voting and proposing new blocks all under algorithmic control. These participants are called **validators**. This transition from PoW to PoS lead to reduction in energy consumption by 99.9% which helped in diminishing the negative sentiment of blockchain technology.

## Introduction to Validators

Validator is a new role that didn't exist previously in PoW consensus. To be able to become a validator, you need to deposit/stake 32 ETH into a Beacon Chain client. (<a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Guide</a> to get started on becoming a validator.)

In Beacon Chain, passage of time is organized into slots and epochs. A slot appears every 12 seconds and an epoch contains 32 slots (appears every 6.4 minutes) and it is used to create checkpoints to reach block/transaction finality which will get into it in later sections.

![slot_epoch](../image/eth2.0_basics/epoch_slots.png)

From the active pool of validators, a subset of validators can become either part of a committee or a block proposer or both! The selection processes are pseudorandom and determined by RANDAO.

1. If a validator becomes a block proposer, the validator can propose a new block on the designated slot however, an empty slot can exist if the block proposer is inactive. (The validator is not penalized for not proposing a block.)

2. If a validator becomes part of a committee, each committee is delegated to a slot within an epoch to attest on the proposed block. More than one committee can exist in each slot.

The assignments of committees and block proposer selection happens before a new epoch starts. Specifically, they are determined at the end of previous epoch.

## Achieving Decentralized Randomness with RANDAO

_Please note that I abbreviated a lot of the cryptography that goes into the RANDAO process. I made this choice to simplify and streamline the explanation. For more details, please refer to the [in-depth explanation](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/randomness/) written by Ben Edgington._

On Beacon Chain, the role of RANDAO value is critical as it is used to determine the selection of committees and block proposers for each upcoming epochs.

This value is determined by the following steps.

1. The block proposer in each slot goes through the process of **revealing** and **mixing**.

- revealing: Revealing is a process of using a BLS signature scheme to create a signature in the current slot. The signature takes in message (current epoch number) and the validator's secret key. The signature is our RANDAO value.
- mixing: We first verify whether the signature was actually created by the validator. This is possible by taking block proposer's public key, message and signature. If the signature is valid, we mix the value with the previous RANDAO value. This is done by doing a xor operation between previous RANDAO value and current revealed RANDAO value.

The formula on mixing operation is :

$$ Rn = Rn \oplus Bn-1 $$

Where,

- $$ Rn $$ is the most recent revealed RANDAO value
- $$ Bn-1 $$ is the RANDAO value after $$ n $$ contributions

This process happens from slot 0 to 31 for each epoch and the final value in slot 31 is used to select the block proposer and committees for the next epoch.

![randao_explanation](../image/eth2.0_basics/randao_explanation.svg)

Thus, the process of each block proposer revealing and mixing RANDAO value achieves decentralized randomness with high entropy (256 bit from secret key). However, this process can be vulnerable to a potential attack vector.

### Example of Attack Vector

For this attack, assume that the Beacon Chain used hashing instead of xor operation to mix their RANDAO value.

Given a scenario where an entity controls the last three block proposers (validators) as shown below.

![randao_attack](../image/eth2.0_basics/randao_attack.svg)

With these three block proposers controlled by the same entity, the entity can commit to a **participation based attack** that can precompute the RANDAO value to their favor.

The entity has access to the private key of the last three elected block proposers. This gives the opportunity to "grind" the best RANDAO value by either proposing a block or not. The entity has access to the private key to these validators therefore, the entity can simulate the reveal and mix operation to precompute the best RANDAO value.

However, this attack vector has been mitigated by using xor operation instead of hashing to mix the RANDAO value. The consensus takes advantage of the commutative property of xor operation that takes away the grinding opportunity that otherwise exists in the hashing operation.

If we refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/9d1e7087b3d0e5d3861b67dcf932158e26332fe3/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md?plain=1#L1729-L1741" target="_blank">mix operation</a>:

```python
def process_randao(state: BeaconState, body: BeaconBlockBody) -> None:
    epoch = get_current_epoch(state)
    # Verify RANDAO reveal
    proposer = state.validators[get_beacon_proposer_index(state)]
    signing_root = compute_signing_root(epoch, get_domain(state, DOMAIN_RANDAO))
    assert bls.Verify(proposer.pubkey, signing_root, body.randao_reveal)
    # Mix in RANDAO reveal
    mix = xor(get_randao_mix(state, epoch), hash(body.randao_reveal))
    state.randao_mixes[epoch % EPOCHS_PER_HISTORICAL_VECTOR] = mix

```

The last two line shows us how the mix operation is done.

Let's assume the entity controls the last two validators $$ v_1, v_2 $$ and the previous RANDAO value is $$ x $$ from slot 29.

![randao_example](../image/eth2.0_basics/randao_example.svg)
If we used hashing exclusively, there can be multiple unique RANDAO values:

Original order:
$$ hash(x, hash(reveal(v_1))) = y $$
$$ hash(y, hash(reveal(v_2))) = z $$

Flipped order:
$$ hash(x, hash(reveal(v_2))) = w $$
$$ hash(w, hash(reveal(v_1))) = p $$

As you can see, when the order is flipped, it generates completely new RANDAO values.

However, with xor operation, the result is same regardless of the order. (Here, we still utilize hash operation to reduce the size of the <a href="https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/randomness/#updating-the-randao:~:text=Second%2C%20the%20hash,of%20BLS%20signatures" target="_blank">aggregated signature</a> from 768 bits to 256 bits).

Original order:
$$ xor(x, hash(reveal(v_1))) = a $$
$$ xor(a, hash(reveal(v_2))) = b $$

Flipped order:
$$ xor(x, hash(reveal(v_2))) = b $$
$$ xor(x, hash(reveal(v_1))) = a $$

The result retains the commutative property.

Of course, the entity can still generate multiple unique RANDAO values by selectively not participating in a particular slot. However, xor's commutative property greatly reduces the entropy for generating multiple unique RANDAO values.

_Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/496" target="_blank"> official discussion </a> to see the details on how the xor operation was chosen instead of just using the hash operation._

## Attesting and Reaching Finality

Validators attest to a proposed block but they also attest on checkpoints. This is to ensure that past proposed blocks can reach finality which means that the blocks and its contained transactions are irreversible.

This leads to two types of attestations:

1. Attesting on individual block within a slot (LMD Ghost Vote)
2. Attesting on a checkpoint (FFG Vote)
