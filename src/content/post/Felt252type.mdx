## Introduction to Mod and Multiplicative Inverse 

In mathematics, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called modulus).

Here are the rules: 

For $$ a \pmod b $$ 

```
1. a < b then a mod b = a 
2. a = b then a mod b = 0 
3. a > b then a/b = r where r is the remainder of a/b
```

The multiplicative inverse is simply : 

$$ 15 * x = 1 $$

This x is the multiplicative inverse of 15. 

So let say we want to find the value of x of the following equation

$$ 3 * x \equiv 1 \pmod{7} $$

The $$ x $$ is the multiplicative inverse of $$ 3 $$  and it is equivalent to $$ 1 \pmod 7 $$

Our goal is to find the value of $$ x $$ **s.t** the value of $$ (3 * x) \div 7 $$ yields the same remainder as $$ 1 \pmod 7 $$.

Therefore, we can say that the value of $$ x $$ is $$ 5 $$ because $$ 3 * 5 = 15 $$ and $$ 15 \div 7 = 2 $$ with a remainder of 1 and it is equivalent to $$ 1 \pmod 7 $$.

## Overview of Felt252 type in Cairo

Felt252 type is a special data type that exists in the [Cairo](https://book.cairo-lang.org/title-page.html) language by [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/).
As from the name, it occupies 252 bits and is used to represent a number in the range of

**#1** $$ 0 <= x < P $$

where **P** is a large prime number equal to


$$ P = 2^{251} + 17 * 2^{192} + 1 $$


In the case of an overflow issue, it uses$$ \pmod P $$ to bring the value back to within the range.

## Division Using Felt252

In Cairo, every division with not nice numbers assumes that it follows the following equation:

**#2** $$ \frac{x}{y} * y == x $$

**Not nice numbers** =  $$ 3 \div 7 $$ , $$ 8 \div 19 $$ ...

With nice numbers, the division operates normally. 

**Nice numbers** = $$ 6 \div 2 $$ , $$ 10 \div 5 $$ ...

As an example. equation **#2** is expanded for the operation $$ 1 \div 2 $$ accordingly to the way that the division is implemented in Cairo.

**#3** $$ \frac{P+1}{2} * 2 = P + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{P} $$ under $$\mathbb{F}_P$$

Cairo implements its division over a finite field and the finite field is defined in **#1**.

Therefore, every non-zero element in the finite field has a multiplicative inverse.

If we reduce equation **#3**, we get:

$$ {P+1} \equiv 1 \pmod{P} $$

Therefore, if we summarize

$$ \frac{1}{2} $$ is

$$ \frac{P+1}{2} * 2 = P + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{P} $$ under $$\mathbb{F}_P$$ which simplifies to

$$ {P+1} \equiv 1 \pmod{P} $$

The $$ * 2 $$ is the multiplicative inverse of $$ \frac{1}{2} $$ and $$ P $$ in $$ P + 1 $$ implies that in case of an overflow, it uses $$ \pmod P $$ to bring the value back to within the range. 

And the $$ \equiv $$ implies that $$ (P + 1) $$ and $$ 1 $$ from $$ 1 \pmod P $$ will yield the same remainder when divided by $$ P $$.

Therefore $$ \frac{1}{2} $$ in Cairo will be same as $$ \frac{P+1}{2} $$ 

This type of division carries benefits when it comes to providing computation for cryptographic proofs.

So to summarize everything, if quotient is an integer, Cairo will output the result like a normal division if not, the computation will align with equation **#2**.
