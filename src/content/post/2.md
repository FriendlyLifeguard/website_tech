We will be looking at how variables are declared and referenced/dereferenced in rust.

<br>

This variable is immutable and referenced variable cannot change the value of `x`

    let x: u64 = 10

This variable is mutable and referenced variable can change the value of `y`

    let mut y: u64 = 10

This variable has an immutable reference to `x` therefore, it cannot be dereferenced to change its value

    let z: &u64 = &x

This variable has a mutable reference to y and can change the value of `y`

    let b: &u64 = &mut y

_You can also make immutable references to mutable variables_

    let n: &u64 = &y

The following variable makes immutable references to `y` therefore, intentionally declaring an immutable variable that references a mutable variable, `y`.
