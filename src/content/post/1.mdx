Function identifiers and signatures are used by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to correctly identify the position in the application binary interface (ABI) to accurately execute the defined and calling of functions.

ABI is a standard format that the EVM uses to read data at machine level.

We have an example solidity function defined below
```
function add(uint a, uint b) public returns (uint)
```
The signature of the function is reduced to the following form
```
add(uint256,uint256)
```
(In solidity, uint is automatically recognized as uint256)

The function identifier is the first 4 bytes of the keccak256 hash of the function signature
```
keccak256("add(uint256,uint256)") = 771602f7
```
The output becomes the identifier for EVM to find and execute the function according to the ABI.
